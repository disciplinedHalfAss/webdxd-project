Issues
1. x-axis overflow
2. Team member intro scroll scanner lag
3. Google map can't seem to be made responsive(map can change size but the landscape inside does not readjust)
4. No good ways to dynamically extend the site

To do list:
1. Content for "Who we are"
2. Team member intro social media buttons
3. Responsive Google Map

Questions:
1. Should we do a bootstrap modal on what we do icons?
